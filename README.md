## Thoughts

Definitely sold on GraphQL being a definite improvement on REST. That said, I ultimately spent too much time trying to get github's implementation working, which isn't quite as comprehensive as the v3 rest. As such, I didn't have time to split the contributors by internal and external.

Overall, enjoyed the exercise and learned quite a bit.
